# GiantBombSwift

A small package creating Swift models and services for connecting to Giantbomb's videogame database. Very early atm, just contains the things I need for my app.

USAGE: Initialise a GiantbombService, passing in your API Key. All the current calls exist in there, eventually they'll be split up.
